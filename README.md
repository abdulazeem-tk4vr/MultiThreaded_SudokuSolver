# MultiThreaded_SudokuSolver
Multi Threaded Sudoku Solver which can solve a valid NxN Sudoku. </br>
- Took advantage of parallelism by implementing multi-threading using pthreads in C. 
- The program would spawn 'N' threads depending on the input whenever it encountered an empty cell.
- Code was submitted to a server for speed and correctness. Program ran for ~ '0' secs and helped me be in the top 10 of the class leaderboard.
